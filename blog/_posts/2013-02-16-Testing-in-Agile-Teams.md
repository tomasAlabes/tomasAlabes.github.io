I have just read this book: Agile Testing: A Practical Guide for Testers and Agile Teams by Lisa Crispin and Janet Gregory, and I would like to share this presentation I've given at work about it.

From the book description:

Testing is a key component of agile development. The widespread adoption of agile methods has brought the need for effective testing into the limelight, and agile projects have transformed the role of testers. Much of a tester’s function, however, remains largely misunderstood. What is the true role of a tester? Do agile teams actually need members with QA backgrounds? What does it really mean to be an “agile tester?”
[...] In Agile Testing, Crispin and Gregory define agile testing and illustrate the tester’s role with examples from real agile teams. They teach you how to use the agile testing quadrants to identify what testing is needed, who should do it, and what tools might help. The book chronicles an agile software development iteration from the viewpoint of a tester and explains the seven key success factors of agile testing.

As a developer is really helpful to know the point of view of agile members whose mainly job is  testing and worrying about the product internal and external quality.
I recommend it.
"Quality is not negotiable."
